        "    * Context: The output explicitly states or strongly implies that a security or "

        "this. The `auth_details` field should attempt to capture any structured information "
        "(e.g., OAuth URLs, scopes needed, realm info) provided by the Primary Agent "

        "\n"
        "1.  **Carefully review the entire output from the Primary Agent.** Understand the "
        "context and the overall message.\n"
        "2.  **Look for explicit keywords and phrases** associated with each category.\n"
        "3.  **Consider the intent** behind the Primary Agent's message.\n"
        "4.  **Prioritize:**\n"
        "    * If authentication is mentioned as a blocker, classify as `auth-required`. "
        "Extract relevant details for the `message` and `auth_details` fields.\n"
        "    * If the agent is clearly asking the user a question to proceed (and it's not "
        "primarily an authentication request), classify as `input-required`. Formulate the "
        "`message` field.\n"
        "    * If the agent explicitly states success, classify as `completed`.\n"
        "    * If the agent explicitly states failure or an insurmountable error (not related "
        "to needing input or auth), classify as `failed`.\n"
        "5.  **Extract Information for `message` and `auth_details`:**\n"
        "    * For `input-required` and `auth-required`, the `message` should be a concise "
        "explanation derived from the Primary Agent's output.\n"
        "    * For `auth-required`, if the Primary Agent's output includes a structured "
        "(e.g., JSON) segment detailing the authentication requirements, attempt to extract "
        "and place this into the `auth_details` field. If no specific structure is found, "
        "`auth_details` can be an empty object `{}`. Do not invent details; only extract "
        "what is provided.\n"
        "6.  **If the output is ambiguous, try to infer the most likely category.** If truly "
        'unclear, you may need a default or "UNCLEAR" category (though this prompt focuses '
        "on the four defined). In such a case, defaulting to `failed` with an appropriate "
        "message might be a safe fallback if no other category fits.\n"
